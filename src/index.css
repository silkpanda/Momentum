/* src/index.css (UPDATED) */

/*
  THIS IS THE FIX:
  We import our custom theme variables FIRST.
  This makes all the variables in theme.css available
  to the @tailwind directives below.
*/
@import "./styles/theme.css";

/*
  This injects Tailwind's "base" styles, which includes
  CSS resets and base element styling.
*/
@tailwind base;

/*
  This injects Tailwind's component classes (like .container).
*/
@tailwind components;

/*
  This injects all of Tailwind's utility classes (like .text-lg).
  This is the part that was failing. Now it will correctly
  find our custom color variables and generate the classes.
